Dr. Jian Gao is a Research Assistant Professor at the [Center for Science of Science and Innovation (CSSI)](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/science-of-science.aspx), [Kellogg School of Management](http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu), [Northwestern University](http://www.northwestern.edu), USA. He is also a Researcher-in-Residence at the [Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems (NICO)](https://www.nico.northwestern.edu). He was a Postdoc at Kellogg CSSI (2019-2021), working with [Prof. Dashun Wang](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/wang_dashun/), and a researcher at [The MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu) (2016-2017), working with [Prof. César A. Hidalgo](https://cesarhidalgo.com).

His primary research interests lie in the interdisciplinary fields of _Science of Science_ and _Computational Social Science_. He uses large-scale data and develops computational approaches to study complex social and economic systems. His research explores how science interacts with a range of social institutions, from public policy to new technology to pharmaceutics. Meanwhile, he studies the equity and sustainability of the workforce that drives scientific research, technological innovation, and economic prosperity.

His works have yielded a range of generalizable insights, which hold direct implications for understanding the role and impact of science beyond science and for promoting an equitable and sustainable workforce. He has published 20+ peer-reviewed articles in leading journals such as *[Science](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6525/128)*, *[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/546033a)*, *[Physics Reports](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370157319301954)*, *[Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26428-z)*, and *[Regional Studies](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00343404.2021.1883191)*. His works have received [1200+ citations](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mvwDL1wAAAAJ) with an [H-index of 18](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mvwDL1wAAAAJ) and have been covered by popular media outlets such as *Scientific American* and *Forbes*.
