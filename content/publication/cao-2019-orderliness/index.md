abstract: "Different from the western education system, Chinese teachers and parents strongly encourage students to have a regular lifestyle. However, due to the lack of large-scale behavioral data, the relation between living patterns and academic performance remains poorly understood. In this chapter, we analyze large-scale behavioral records of 18,960 students within a Chinese university campus. In particular, we introduce orderliness, a novel entropy-based metric, to measure the regularity of campus lifestyle. Empirical analyses demonstrate that orderliness is significantly and positively correlated with academic performance, and it can improve the prediction accuracy on academic performance at the presence of diligence, another behavioral metric that estimates studentsâ€™ studying hardness. This work supports the eastern pedagogy that emphasizes the value of regular lifestyle."
