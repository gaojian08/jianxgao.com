abstract: "A conspiracy network is embedded in a network of employees of a company, with each edge representing a message sent from one employee (node) to another and categorized by topics. Given a few known criminals, a few known non-criminals, and suspicious topics, we seek to estimate the probability of criminal involvement for other individuals and to determine the leader of the conspirators."
